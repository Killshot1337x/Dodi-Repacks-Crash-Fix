# Dodi-Repacks-Crash-Fix
A simple but detailed guide which focusses on crashfixes for games download through dodi repacks


### This guide is for people who are facing crash issues with games downloaded from dodi repacks.We'll be focussing on the common causes for these crashes in this guide.A star to the repo would be appreciated.

Before we begin, you should know how to run event viewer to diagnose errors. [Here's a quick guide for it](https://pastebin.com/VxM1ZKW5)

**Case #1: Game not launching at all** 

Fix 1-
        This is a fix if your crack has been damaged by your anti virus.Always keep all your Anti Viruses disabled when 
        dealing with repacks. 
        
        To see if your anti virus is causing the error, run event viewer. If you see an error which specifies the faulting module as 
        dll or exe file present in the game directory, this fix is for you. After turning your anti virus off, go to your torrent client and force recheck the torrent.
        Here's a simple guide for it: https://telegra.ph/Rehash-Force-Recheck-files-in-torrent-clients-03-02
        Then re install the game and see if it works.Alternatively, you can get cracks from cs.rin.ru, but force rechecking is easier.

Fix 2-
       

        Run event viewer using the guide given at the start of the guide.If you notice an error which says that the Faulting module 
        name: ntdll.dll,it is a windows build error. In this case, you'll have to either switch to windows 10, or windows 11
        build 22478. 
**SOME CRACKS DO NOT WORK AS INTENDED ON ALL BUILDS OF WIN 11**

        There are many guides on youtube and google, which will guide you on how to switch to that specific build/windows.
        I'm mentioning 2 of them here:

        Guide to switch to win 10- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPY7g6GnSg0 
        PS: You can use programs like KMS to activate win10/11 for free
**Case #2- 
        The game launched earlier but it's not launching now/the game is crashing at specific points only**
